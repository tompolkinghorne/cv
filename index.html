  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p title="About Tom Polkinghorne">Hi there! My name is Tom, I am 19 years old and I am based in Glen Iris, Victoria. I graduated from Scotch College in 2018 attaining the Ewen Davidson Prize for Excellence in Sport. I am currently studying Part-Time Online at Deakin University
    doing a Bachelor of Health Sciences. In my working life, I've had a year of experience in Sport Coaching and Retail. Key skills required for coaching and retail is having strong Communication and Interpersonal Skills, which are skills I both
    posses. I have worked in many team environments before and I love to take on and accomplish new challenges! I believe that if you put in the hard work - huge dividends will pay off! I look forward to meeting you!
